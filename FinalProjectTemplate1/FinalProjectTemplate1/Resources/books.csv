102,Agile ALM,1935182633,119.21,2.1,0.42,464,2011-08-20,Many software projects fail unnecessarily because of unclear objectives; redundant and unproductive work; cost overruns; and a host of other avoidable process problems. In response; agile processes and lightweight tooling have begun to replace traditional engineering processes throughout the development lifecycle. An agile approach to application lifecycle management improves product quality; reduces time to market; and makes for happier developers.    Agile ALM is a guide for Java developers who want to integrate flexible agile practices and lightweight tooling along all phases of the software development process. The book introduces a new vision for managing change in requirements and process more efficiently and flexibly. You'll learn powerful practices like task-based Development; where you align activities into tasks resulting in traceable artifacts; Continuous Integration; in which you frequently and systematically integrate; build; and test an application in development and using Scrum as an agile approach to release management. The effect is a more comprehensive and practical approach to build; configuration; deployment; release; test; quality; integration; and requirements management.    This book synthesizes technical and functional elements to provide a comprehensive approach to software development. You'll learn to see the whole scope of the development process as a set of defined tasks; many of which are repeated daily; and then master the tools and practices you need to accomplish each of those tasks efficiently.    Because efficient tool chains can radically improve the speed and fluidity of the development process; this book demonstrates how to integrate state-of-the-art lightweight tools. Many of the tools and examples are Java-based; but the Agile ALM principles apply to all development platforms. As well; the many examples show how you can bridge different languages and systems.,Michael Hüttermann,Software Engineering,N,1900-01-01,1900-01-01,.
